# Classification-of-Houses-and-Flats

## Data Mining Alternative Deep Learning Assignment

#### Project Overview

To discriminate between houses and flats from 2-dimensional image data using CNN

#### Problem Statement

In this project, we were given real world dataset and to examine how deep learning, a subset of machine learning algorithms that is well suited to recognising patterns can help us classify images. If the project succeeds, the model can be used by professionals such as surveyors to calculate housing density within a given area in company with other imaging tools like Google Maps or drone mapping.

The method determined is through a deep learning approach. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is used, as the convolutional property simulates human vision and it has been applied successfully to other computer vision problems such as autonomous vehicles, Google Translate application, facial recognition, healthcare, real-time sports tracking and manufacturing.
